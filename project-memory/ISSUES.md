## Resolved
- I001 — git inside the Claude Cowork sandbox cannot delete its own lock/temp files on the
  mounted folder ("Operation not permitted"), leaving a stale `.git/index.lock` that blocks the
  next git write. Fix (Cowork sessions only): call the `allow_cowork_file_delete` tool once,
  then `rm -f .git/*.lock` and delete `.git/objects/**/tmp_obj_*`. Windows/Antigravity/other
  agents are unaffected. Resolved 2026-08-11.
