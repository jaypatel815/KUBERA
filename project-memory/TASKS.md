## Backlog — Owner actions (Chotu — nothing else is blocked on these yet, but T005/T006 gate Phase 1 completion)
- [ ] T005 — GitHub repo created + remote added ✔ (2026-08-11). Remaining: push `main` from your machine (sandbox has no GitHub auth) and confirm the Actions CI run is green.
- [x] T006 — Alpaca paper keys in `.env` — done 2026-08-11 (owner). Note: owner's `.env` uses `ALPACA_API_KEY` naming + extra vars from another template; settings loader accepts both spellings, extras ignored.
- [ ] T007 — **Phase 1 sign-off, nearly done:** verify.py passed on Windows 68/68 incl. the 3 live paper tests (per Gemini's 2026-08-11 session ✔). Remaining: `alembic -c backend\alembic.ini upgrade head` + `python scripts\sync.py` + open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/portfolio` once.
- [x] T008 — pre-commit installed — done 2026-08-11 (owner). Sandbox-side caveat: I003.

## Backlog — Phase 2: Analysis & insight engine (agents)
- [ ] T023 — Fundamentals + news ingestion: evaluate the owner's existing FMP/FRED keys (D009) vs Alpaca news; verify key validity + tier limits first, then pick and integrate one source.
- [ ] T016 — Schwab Trader API read-only sync (owner's real thinkorswim account): positions + balances alongside Alpaca paper, same timestamped model shapes. Prereqs: owner confirms Schwab developer app/keys are active; agent verifies current API capabilities (paper endpoint? scopes?) before building. Live orders out of scope pending §7.4. (D009)

## Backlog — Phase 3: Backtesting & strategy sandbox (agents)
- [ ] T035 — Paper-loop hardening (follow-up to T032): persist risk-engine trip state + day baseline to DB so restarts can't bypass the breaker; sync fills from Alpaca activities into `transactions`; consider market-hours guard. Small but safety-relevant.
- [ ] T034 — Backtest results ledger: persist runs (strategy, params, date range, metrics) to DB; comparison endpoint; feeds the §7.4 promotion checklist.

## Backlog — Phase 4: Conversation layer (agents; unblocked — §3 registry is done)
- [ ] T040 — KUBERA persona + system prompt (docs + code constant): sharp analyst voice per spec §1; always states data recency + confidence; never invents numbers (tools only); refuses certainty framing; confirm-before-capital rule.
- [ ] T041 — LLM provider abstraction: Anthropic/OpenAI/Gemini behind one interface, keys from .env (owner already has several), provider pick via settings; no SDK lock-in; mock-based tests.
- [ ] T042 — POST /api/chat: conversation loop executing registry tools (T024), conversation + message persistence in DB, timestamped tool-call audit trail per spec §2.7.
- [ ] T043 — Conversation safety rails as code: order-related intents require explicit confirmation tokens; responses must carry data-recency line — enforced by post-checks, tested.
- [ ] T044 — Context assembly: portfolio state + recent messages + relevant research memory into the prompt within a token budget; deterministic selection logic, tested.
